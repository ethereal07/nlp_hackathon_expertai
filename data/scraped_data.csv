The announcement includes $19.2 billion of public and private funds for conservation efforts. In addition, 28 countries have committed to ensuring trade in globally important commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soy does not contribute to deforestation.Saving the world’s dwindling forests is essential if we are to avoid dangerous climate change. Forests soak up carbon from the atmosphere, and cutting them down releases it. On balance, forests removed about 7.6 billion tons of carbon every year over the last two decades. This is roughly 15% of global emissions.Much of Madagascar has been deforested to make way for small-scale agriculture.But forests around the world are moving from net sinks of carbon, which soak up more than they release, to net sources. While the Amazon rainforest as a whole remains a carbon sink (for now), ongoing land clearance in parts of the Brazilian Amazon mean forests there are already emitting more carbon than they absorb. Increasing global temperatures are causing more forest fires too, further raising emissions from forests and so driving global temperatures higher.Given that the window for keeping global warming below 1.5°C, or even 2°C, is rapidly closing, humanity desperately needs remaining forests to stay standing. So is the Glasgow leaders’ declaration on forests and land use up to the task?This is only the most recent commitment to stop forest loss in a series of similar initiatives. Back in 2005, the U.N. Forum on Forests committed to “reverse the loss of forest cover worldwide” by 2015. In 2008, 67 countries pledged to try and reach zero net deforestation by 2020. This was followed by the New York declaration on forests in 2014 which saw 200 countries, civil society groups and indigenous peoples’ organizations commit to halve deforestation by 2020 and end it by 2030.These earlier efforts clearly failed to meet their targets. On average, rates of forest loss have been 41% higher in the years since the New York agreement was signed. It’s almost impossible to know what deforestation rates would have been without these pledges.It is important not to vilify those clearing tropical forests. In most cases, whether it’s oil-palm plantation workers in southeast Asia, or the owner of a family-run cocoa farm in Ghana, these are just ordinary people trying to make a living. Where those clearing forest are poor subsistence farmers with few alternatives, such as many in Madagascar for example, preventing forest clearance can mean some of the poorest people on the planet are bearing the cost of tackling climate change. Given that such people contribute relatively few emissions, this isn’t very fair.What we do know is that progress on slowing deforestation has been wildly inadequate. The good news is Brazil, Russia and China, which did not sign the 2014 declaration, have this time. However, words are cheap. Actually slowing deforestation is difficult to achieve.The causes of forest loss vary from place to place, but the problem boils down to a conflict between those who benefit from deforestation and those who benefit from keeping forests intact, and whose ability to influence what happens on the ground wins out.Conserving forests benefits everybody by stabilizing the climate. But logging, or clearing a patch of forest for farming, benefits the people involved in a much more direct and tangible way. Ultimately, to keep forests intact, those who benefit from forests (that’s all of us) need to fund efforts to conserve them.Despite criticism, and problems with implementation, this is the underlying rationale to REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation), the U.N. mechanism whereby tropical nations are paid for efforts to conserve forests.Just before flying to Glasgow, Madagascar’s minister of environment and sustainable development, Baomiavotse Vahinala Raharinirina, visited a village to ask people their views on what would make forest conservation more effective. They spoke about the lack of alternative livelihoods, the need for more support to help them manage the forest sustainably, and the fact that local communities often lack the ability to exclude those who wish to exploit forests.Raharinirina and British Ambassador David Ashley discuss efforts to slow deforestation with people living near Madagascar’s rainforest.Raharinirina said:""Madagascar has contributed relatively little to climate change, but our people are suffering the consequences. For example, a million people in the south are in need of food aid because of the effects of a drought caused by climate change. We are trying to do our bit to reduce emissions by conserving and restoring our forests and have signed the Glasgow Leaders Declaration, however this won’t be achieved without more resources… We will need support from the international community to help us achieve this.""I am cautiously impressed with how much attention is being paid to the question of fairly reducing tropical deforestation at COP26. The first event in the UK-led program brought forest communities and indigenous people together to discuss lessons from the last decade of forest conservation.Panelists speaking about the last decade of forest conservation (from left to right): Tuntiak Katan, Raymond Samndong, Sarobidy Rakotonarivo, Dolores de Jesus Cabnal Coc, Victoria Tauli-Corpuz.Perhaps I am naive, but I sense a helpful change in tone among world leaders, from assuming that forest conservation inevitably delivers triple wins which benefit the climate, biodiversity and local livelihoods, to a more honest acknowledgement that often, there are winners and losers. Only by finding ways for conservation to benefit those who live alongside forests can the world hope to keep those forests absorbing emissions for years to come.So, will this pledge finally halt and reverse deforestation? Unlikely. But given the importance of the issue, the renewed focus on deforestation at COP26 is certainly positive.This story is part of The Conversation’s coverage on COP26, the Glasgow climate conference, by experts from around the world.Amid a rising tide of climate news and stories, The Conversation is here to clear the air and make sure you get information you can trust.

https://www.derrynews.com/news/solid-waste-working-group-holds-first-meeting/article_72fcfbf6-3c2d-11ec-b6eb-7ff06ff3df3b.html,"Morning fog, then cloudy in the afternoon. Slight chance of a rain shower. High 67F. Winds light and variable..
                                Rain showers in the evening, then fog developing overnight. Low 58F. Winds light and variable. Chance of rain 40%. Updated: October 25, 2022 @ 2:15 amCONCORD — The organizational meeting of the Solid Waste Working Group outlined the challenges ahead for the group whose five-year mission is to assist the state Department of Environmental Services in long-range planning and to make recommendations for changes in the existing solid waste reduction, recycling, and management policies.Mike Wimsatt, director of the Waste Management Division, explained that the group, established through House Bill 413, is a self-directed, autonomous collection of volunteers and that his division’s role is merely to provide information to make their task easier. Mike Nork, administrator of the newly created Materials Management Education and Planning Division within DES, will provide additional resources, including new rules and information on legislative initiatives that are taking place.The group elected Rep. Karen Ebel, D-New London, as its chair. She had served on an earlier panel that helped to develop HB 413, so she brings to the table background experience on the goal-setting as well as an understanding of the underlying issues. She had become involved after seeing the disruption in the recycling industry after China announced it would close its market for United States recyclable materials two years ago.Reagan Bissonnette of the nonprofit Northeast Resource Recovery Association said in nominating Ebel as chair that it was important to select someone without an economic interest in waste management, as many members of the group have. She said it also was important to select a chair who will be around for the duration of the discussions, saying that those working for a company or nonprofit might be replaced at any time. Ebel, even if she does not get re-elected to the legislature, can remain involved, Bissonnette said.The legislation creating the working group specified that there be representation from the House, the Senate, the Waste Management Council, owners of in-state landfills, in-state solid waste haulers, companies that reprocess waste into products, the NRRA, cities with single-stream recycling, rural communities doing source separation, the healthcare industry, the Northeast Recycling Council, the Department of Business and Economic Affairs, and the DES, as well as someone with expertise in sustainability.Ebel recommended that the group plan to mean every two months, with the possibility of having subcommittees working on specific issues between general meetings. They tentatively plan to meet in early-to mid-December, after the Solid Waste Bureau has finished drafting its biennial solid waste report on waste disposal reduction.By way of having everyone get to know each other, Ebel had the members introduce themselves and their particular issues. Planning, disposal capacity, recycling options, and the infrastructure to handle any recommendations coming forward were some of the matters of concern.Ebel noted that public interest in solid waste disposal has increased with Casella Waste System’s proposal for a controversial new landfill near Forest Lake State Park in Dalton.John Swan, who represents Save Forest Lake, was videotaping the meeting and commented afterward that, while he was happy with Ebel’s selection as chair, he was disturbed by her comments about the legal issues surrounding out-of-state solid waste.Ebel noted that the courts have declared that, under the Interstate Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution, a state cannot refuse to accept solid waste from another state, creating a capacity problem for New Hampshire’s landfills.“As we all know,” Swan commented later, “our state is plagued with an extraordinary amount of waste that is hauled into our borders, to the tune of approximately 50% of what is landfilled, thus taking up precious, existing space. I would hope that the SWWG would examine the efforts of both Maine and Vermont relative to their curbing of out-of-state waste, as we need to address that very problematic issue, not dismiss it at the very first meeting.”He was happier with Ebel’s other comment, that local land use regulations must be observed.“Despite the fact that the citizens of my town, Dalton, have voted to enact zoning twice in the last 2 1/2 years, in an effort to stop the Casella landfill project next to Forest Lake State Park, and despite the town select board sending several letters to NHDES to inform them of the fact that Casella refuses to acknowledge local control and submit an application locally for its project, the permitting process at NHDES for this obviously unwanted landfill continues,” Swan said.Others are advocating for a radical departure from the current focus on simply reducing the amount of solid waste. Karen Lajoie of Charlestown and John Tuthill of Acworth say that the target should be zero waste.In an electronic letter to members of the committee on Oct. 17, they stated, “Casella, Wheelabrator, and Waste Management of NH run facilities that displace the value of resources by making waste itself a commodity. This mindset encourages high volumes of waste and inevitably leads to expansion plans that polarize and threaten communities.”They quote Zero Waste International Alliance: “The easiest, first step that can produce significant climate results RIGHT NOW is to STOP landfill-produced methane. Simply by getting COOL — Compostable Organics Out of Landfills — we can prevent potent methane emissions AND build healthier soils.”The working group’s initial meeting discussed food waste diversion as one way to greatly decrease the amount of solid waste. Marc Morgan of Lebanon said that 15 percent of that city’s solid waste is food scraps and they have drop-off sites for food waste. They accept both meat and dairy waste and compost food scraps on unused sections of their landfill site.Few places accept meat and dairy waste, however, and Duncan Watson of Keene said banning items like food waste without having a place to send them creates problems. “We don’t have the infrastructure to make diversion happen,” he said.T.P.

Some carried picket signs expressing their opposition to a site, building and operations plan for a Dollar General store at 4949 Erie St.CALEDONIA — Nearby residents who had vocally and passionately opposed a proposed Dollar General at 4949 Erie St. had a joyful and celebratory end to their night Monday.The Village Board denied a site, building and operations plan for the business by a unanimous vote at its meeting Monday.The vote came after a series of events, including the board previously tabling the proposal at its Sept. 7 meeting, a public hearing at the Oct. 25 Planning Commission meeting where approximately 25 residents voiced their opposition, a development representative claiming to have a “silent majority” on his side and the Planning Commission voting unanimously to recommend approval of the proposal.Approximately 20 residents spoke during the citizen comment portion of the Monday Village Board meeting.A representative from Dollar General hadn’t showed at any of these three meetings. Development representatives present did not comment during the meeting and could not be reached Tuesday by a reporter.About 100 residents packed the Village Hall at 5043 Chester Lane and some carried picket signs expressing their opposition.The Village Board denied the proposal due to concerns about safety at the intersection of Four Mile Road and Erie Street, and conflicts with truck delivery traffic. The motion approved stated the site is too small for such a Dollar General retail use.WeatherstonMcManusThe motion came from Trustee Tom Weatherston and was seconded by Trustee Holly McManus. The motion passed 6 to 0 — and the crowd erupted in clapping and cheer. Several members of the audience embraced.Trustee Lee Wishau, who led the meeting in President Jim Dobbs’ absence, said some of the public comments from truck drivers expressing space concerns rang true for him. He said he worked the last 15 years of his career for Kroger/Roundy’s.Wishau“I’ve always been skeptical of that corner with an 18-wheeler,” Wishau said. “I didn’t see how that would work out. But the experts tell us it would, I wasn’t sure … and I was always concerned as well about the fact that deliveries don’t always show up as they’re scheduled.”He also brought up the fact that parking on the road there isn’t allowed and a truck probably couldn’t fit in the parking lot.“I think if anything, if this ever comes back, however this ends up, we will have to figure out how to do the intersection better to accommodate something,” Wishau said. “There seems to be this misunderstanding that we went out and sought this particular development here. We don’t have the power to do that. We don’t decide anybody’s business plan.”“The Planning Commission is not interested in who’s occupying the building; it has to do with the building only,” Weatherston said. “So I understand your concerns, but the commission passed this twice because, based on just the building … the board does not select where construction sites are, or development. That comes from the developer.”McManus said she appreciates the audience members who attended the meeting. She said she went to the Dollar General at 3440 Douglas Ave. before coming to the Village Hall Monday and met with “nice employees, but I wasn’t happy with the way the exterior looks,” she said. “We are taking the time and we are hearing you. This has nothing to do with greed. We care about what you folks have to say … we have done everything that we can and I do think that the traffic is our primary concern.”Many of the citizens’ comments were similar to points expressed at the Oct. 25 Planning Commission public hearing, including concerns about safety, crime and violence, air and noise pollution, vehicle traffic, decreased property/home values and Dollar General representatives absent from meetings. Many residents pushed for the dollar store to be located in the former Kmart building at 5141 Douglas Ave.Residents were given two minutes to speak but some spoke for 10 minutes or more after others present “gave” their two minutes to the speakers.Resident Theresie Bode said it’s easy to tell whether an area is “in decline” or improving just by driving past it.“Just out of curiosity, does anybody think that if a Dollar General is put on Four Mile and Erie Street, anybody is going to drive past and say, ‘Woohoo! Rock on for Caledonia!’? Not a soul.”Several attendees spoke as “experts” on particular topics such as firefighting and emergency medical services, law enforcement, and truck driving.Resident Michelle Frank, who spoke about potential EMS issues, also said she has three children who have a bus stop in the location.“There’s no safe way for them to actually properly come through,” Frank said. “Again, there’s no sidewalks. How are we protecting our children from dealing with this scenario? How are we ensuring that our children are safe?”Resident Ryan Veselik said he has his commercial driver’s license and previously had to deliver to 27th Street in Greenfield in Milwaukee County. A business there had to put in a bigger parking lot to accommodate his 45-foot semi truck.“I can tell you that that (Dollar General) parking lot does not work,” Veselik said. “As a CDL (commercial driver’s license) driver, my worst fear was hitting someone. And to now have this mom up here (Frank) telling me that there’s a bus stop there?”Resident Angela Obradovic said she has a background in supply chain and logistics. She also voiced concerns about truck traffic.“It has been my experience that many retail stores, especially smaller ones in residential areas, or in strip malls, are not designed to make deliveries efficient. They are designed for consumers,” Obradovic said. “These types of parking lot deliveries can cause damage to property vehicles and cause traffic accidents due to blind spots, depending on where the truck is parked.”Wind Point Village President Susan Sanabria spoke about development compromise. She said within the last week she started receiving phone calls and text messages from residents who were opposed to the Dollar General.“A development needs to be the right size, the right improvement and the right architecture with the surrounding environment,” Sanabria said. “I understand all the issues that you’re contending with, but I would hate to see another development that destroys the largely residential quality — it is all so residential.”She said Wind Point’s recent development struggles taught the village to listen to people in the community and adapt. Wind Point’s borders are about a mile east of where the Dollar General was proposed.“I urge you” Sanabria said, “to think about what we went through and our development experiences, and I wish you well.”The Starbucks Coffee at 4917 Douglas Ave. opened in Caledonia on June 24; its next-door neighbor, the latest O&H Danish Bakery location, is set to open Wednesday.The front of Starbucks, located at 4917 Douglas Avenue, is pictured on Thursday.The inside of Starbucks is pictured on Thursday.Farm-themed art is hung on the wall inside the new Starbucks in Caledonia on Thursday.Customers head to the front counter to pick up an order inside the new Starbucks at 4917 Douglas Ave., Caledonia, on Thursday.Caron Butler and his close friends and family browse the menu at Starbucks on Thursday.From left, Caron Butler, Lee Jaramillo and Racine County Executive Jonathan Delagrave pose for a photo in front of Starbucks on Thursday.NBA Basketball Star Caron Butler and Jonathan Delagrave, Racine County Executive, meet for the first time at the Starbucks opening in Caledonia on Thursday.A barista works on coffee orders at the new Starbucks in Caledonia on Thursday.Customers place an order at Starbucks on Thursday.Customers sit and talk on the front patio of Starbucks on Thursday in Caledonia.Subscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.ReporterRachel Kubik covers Racine County government for The Journal Times as well as eastern municipalities such as Caledonia and Wind Point.

John Yudichak, I-Swoyersville, said in a statement.The facility is expected to produce 64,000 barrels per day of Nacero’s zero-sulphur low-carbon footprint gasoline, made from renewable and natural renewable gasoline, not crude oil.The company claims its production method results in a gasoline that cuts the carbon footprint of a vehicle’s fuel in half, compared to existing fuels. Nacero’s gasoline can be used to fuel cars and trucks without any modifications, according to the company.“This news is good for our economy and our environment,” state Rep. Aaron Kaufer, R-Luzerne, said in a House Republican Caucus statement. “We can have good-paying jobs and a cleaner environment at the same time with this investment.”The announcement came after Gov. Tom Wolf signed into law a measure that provides tax credits to petrochemical plants, like Nacero, in northeastern Pennsylvania.2020 Act 66 establishes the Local Resource Manufacturing Tax Credit, which requires a company to invest $400 million in the construction of a new manufacturing facility, create 800 jobs, pay prevailing wages and use carbon capture and sequestration technology “when economically feasible.”Beginning in 2024, eligible companies can buy dry natural gas at a tax credit of 47 cents per unit. Tax credits for the program are capped at just over $26.6 million annually, per the law.Wolf had vetoed the bill earlier last year, but legislators again passed it months later. The administration signed the legislation after negotiations guaranteed prevailing wage benefits and limited the cost to taxpayers.The decision upset environmental groups and some Democrats, who said the bill prioritized handouts to gas companies over the health and safety of residents.“The fracked gas and petrochemical industries cannot be trusted to operate safely in the Commonwealth,” Jacquelyn Bonomo, president and CEO of PennFuture, said in July. “Instead of holding the industry accountable, our so-called leaders are giving them millions in precious taxpayer dollars.”The Pennsylvania Manufacturers Association said the law, introduced by Kaufer, will create at least 4,400 permanent jobs and realize $1.6 billion in economic benefits to the region.Nacero plans to begin work on the plant as early as next year, with the project estimated to be completed by 2027, according to a House Republican Caucus press release."

Updated: October 25, 2022 @ 2:01 amPerpetual Industries of Auburn has moved its headquarters into this renovated building next to Kruse Plaza, southwest of Auburn.AUBURN — Perpetual Industries announced Tuesday that it has moved into its new corporate headquarters southwest of Auburn.The 22,000-square-foot, newly renovated building stands next to Kruse Plaza and the Early Ford V-8 Foundation buildings on the west side of Interstate 69, north of C.R. 11-A.Perpetual Industries moved its operations from Alberta, Canada, to Kruse Plaza in 2019.In February, Perpetual acquired Worldwide Auctioneers of Auburn, also housed in Kruse Plaza. A collector car auction company founded by John Kruse of Auburn and Rod Egan, Worldwide continues to operate independently under their leadership as a wholly owned subsidiary of Perpetual.John Kruse is a co-owner of Kruse Plaza, which occupies the building that originally housed the Kruse Museums of collector cars and World War II history.Perpetual’s new home originally was built by museums founder Dean V. Kruse to house a museum of memorabilia for auto racing legend Andy Granatelli. When the late Mr. Granatelli did not complete his plans for a museum, the structure for a while became the home for an antiques and auction business before its recent renovation.In a news release, Perpetual described its home base of Auburn as “a hotbed for manufacturing and technology with access to abundant power sources.”“We have seen significant growth in the operation of our divisions over the past couple of years. It made sense to increase our space to maximize the company’s return on assets and capitalize on the fast-growing blockchain ecosystem with our data center expansion,” said Perpetual Industries CEO Brent Bedford.Perpetual describes itself as “an incubator for the development of new and innovative energy-efficient technologies.” Its website says the company’s mission is to “perpetuate industry” by bringing value-added technologies to market.“At the company’s core is a proprietary technology known as the XYO Mechanical Balancing Technology, designed specifically to dynamically eliminate vibration in rotating equipment to create energy-efficient, environmentally responsible products,” Perpetual’s website says.Perpetual also is developing “low-cost, green-energy-powered solutions for a variety of industries, including renewable energy, blockchain mining, artificial intelligence, graphic rendering, internet of things and cloud computing.”Perpetual’s website says one of its goals is to “advance and integrate green-energy power sources such as solar, wind, and hydro into computer processing to lessen the environmental impact and cost of power consumed by miners in the fast-emerging global decentralized Blockchain industry.”On June 22, the company activated an array of 847 solar panels installed on a portion of the massive roof of Kruse Plaza.“We’re going to show the world how to mine environmentally responsibly” for crypto-currency, which requires large quantities of electricity, Bedford said at the time.Over Labor Day weekend, Perpetual launched its AutoGrafic Software division, developed for car enthusiasts in partnership with Travis LaVine and Jason Stoller of LaVine Restorations in Nappanee. Classic cars restored by LaVine Restorations have won numerous awards at the Auburn Cord Duesenberg Club reunion in Auburn and other prestigious car shows across the nation.Perpetual says AutoGrafic uses “cutting-edge technology to host a myriad of features for automotive promotion and preservation” — including collection management, social events, car auctions, insurance, research, preservation and historical documentation.In August, Perpetual released its financial results for the first six months of 2021, including Revenues of $2,678,361 and gross profits of $1,102,822.The company’s stock trades on the OTC Markets under the symbol PRPI. At midday Tuesday, it was trading for 29.8 cents per share, up 2.76% for the day.

https://thewestsidegazette.com/how-a-search-for-clean-air-turned-into-the-worlds-favorite-pollution-app/,"  By Diana BletterIf you ask Siri, “What’s my air quality today?” its go-to source for information on air quality is BreezoMeter. The World Health Organization, Apple, Yahoo and others use its services. The United Nations named the company one of six high-tech companies changing the world for the better.
CEO Ran Korber is a cutting-edge entrepreneur who started the company that provides 400 million people around the world with the most comprehensive, real-time information about air pollution, wildfires and environmental hazards.“I could speak forever about air pollution and environmental hazards,” Korber said, emphasizing that the environment is not something that is “out there — it’s very personal.”Korber’s wife has asthma. In 2012, when she was pregnant with their first child, they wanted to find the healthiest place to live. Korber, an environmental engineer, was shocked to learn that local reports weren’t accurate, and pollution sensor units didn’t provide enough information.Korber asked for help from his best friend, Emil Fisher, a software engineer who loved solving problems, and Ziv Lautman, who worked at the Environmental Protection Agency. The three men’s first assignment was developing an algorithm to calculate environmental factors in several locations.Fast forward nine years, numerous awards, a visit to the White House and more than $15 million in funding from prominent investors.Today, BreezoMeter’s advanced algorithms and machine learning can analyze data from satellites and thousands of sensors, incorporating information on dozens of different pollens and pollutants, wildfires, traffic jams and even Super Bowl games to provide real-time, accurate information on air quality around the world.Air pollution, wildfires and COVIDAir pollution is increasing exponentially. Earth’s climate changes have caused an uptick in wildfires across the globe. Each year, the severity of these wildfires increases 10 times over the previous year. BreezoMeter’s recently launched live wildfire tracker provides vital information for individuals and businesses.Studies show that people in areas with high levels of air pollution have higher blood pressure, more asthma, more obesity and exacerbated mental conditions. Where people live, their personal environment, has a huge impact on their wellbeing. Congress recently passed a bill to address the disproportionate adverse effects of environmental hazards on people in low-income communities.At the start of the pandemic in March 2020, BreezoMeter’s researchers found higher levels of the disease in areas with more air pollution. People with preexisting health conditions are more susceptible to COVID, and as Korber says, “An area with severe air pollution is a preexisting condition.”Each year, air pollution kills approximately seven million people. And wildfires intensify that air pollution with dangerous smoke traveling up to 3,000 miles away.In BreezoMeter’s conference room, Korber opens a map of California where at least two wildfires are raging, spreading air pollution to surrounding states. Until now, he said, people had little idea in which direction a fire is going and when it would be contained.He points to Alisal, a huge fire raging near Santa Barbara, California. The BreezoMeter app lets drivers know of the range of the fire so they can avoid certain danger.Measuring air qualityTemperature is easy to measure. But until BreezoMeter invented its Air Quality Index, BAQI, there was no worldwide standard for measuring air quality.In Hong Kong, for example, the air quality range goes from 1 to 10+, with 10 indicating hazardous air conditions. In the United States, the range goes from 1 (best) to 500 (worst). The BAQI shows zero being the worst and 100 being the best.BreezoMeter’s index includes ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide and four other major pollutants. People can’t see air pollution, Korber said, which is why it’s so dangerous. Yet you can see the number on the index and easily understand it.Companies like Bosch, Dyson and AstraZeneca now use BreezoMeter’s forecasts to alert people to worsening air quality.Someone with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, for instance, can start taking medication in advance because if it’s taken too late, it doesn’t work. Studies show that this forecasting has helped decrease the number of emergency hospital visits by 57 percent, which is good for everyone.The company recently signed a deal with Volvo, known for its emphasis on auto safety, in which BreezoMeter’s information about air quality is included in all new cars’ standard features. If there is a sudden rise in air pollution, drivers can roll up their windows and turn on the air purifier system.The most important missionKorber said he has always been motivated to search for a way to contribute to the world.Before attending the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in 2004, he worked as a security guard at a chemical plant. Undecided about what to study, he asked the 500 people going in and out of the plant about their job. “Do you enjoy your job? Does it contribute to the world? Would you want your child to do the same kind of work?”He found that 80 percent of the people were doing something they didn’t like. He even got up the nerve to pose the same question to the deputy CEO, who said that if Korber studied environmental engineering, the company would hire him. And that’s what happened.To start BreezoMeter, Korber and Fisher (who also suffers from asthma) quit their day jobs because they realized that “we had the most important mission, and we had to invest all of ourselves.“The likelihood of being successful with your startup is about as high as winning the lottery,” Korber said.And yet they were successful. The company has raised $45 million to date and has 80 employees, including atmospheric, environmental and brain scientists. The plan is to provide even more information, such as earthquake forecasts and radiation levels, and to reach one billion users in 2022.‘Our thoughts have power’To celebrate its centennial next year, Technion is publishing a book highlighting 100 of its notable graduates — including Nobel Prize winners and Korber.Korber not only gets to work with his best friend, Fisher, but also said that his office location is serendipitous. It’s in the building that houses a well-known restaurant where he proposed marriage to his wife.Korber credits his success, in part, to the book, “The Secret”, about visualizing what you want manifested in your life.“If you think about things, you will be directed to those things,” he said.“It makes perfect sense according to quantum physics,” Korber said. “If e=mc2, if energy is connected to matter, then our thoughts have power.”He also believes that developing positive habits can contribute to success. He said we need to “think about what we want to achieve, and not what we’re afraid of.”Built to lastFor Korber, finding the right work/life balance has been challenging but since the pandemic started, the company allows people to work remotely, giving employees flexibility.With all their investors, Korber and his partners could already make a fast exit, but “we’re not just a startup, we’re a scale-up, built to last.”Produced in association with Israel21C.

https://www.khaleejtimes.com/expo/costa-ricas-reforestation-programme-wins-expo-2020-supported-earthshot-prize,"Tuesday, Oct 25, 2022 | Rabi Al-Awwal 29 1444Published: Mon 18 Oct 2021, 7:37 PMCosta Rica has become the first country to be awarded as an Earthshot Prize winner, for an innovative programme that has reversed decades of deforestation by paying small farmers to plant trees and restore ecosystems.The Earthshot Prize, founded by the Duke of Cambridge in October 2020 to reward countries and organisations aiming to find solutions to the world’s biggest environmental problems, was announced at a glittering ceremony in London last night (October 17). Expo 2020 Dubai – together with DP World, Expo 2020’s Global Trade Partner – is a Global Alliance Founding Partner of the prize.Four other winners were awarded on the night, representing projects in India, Italy and the Bahamas, as well as a multinational team that has invented a technology that turns renewable electricity into emission-free hydrogen gas that fuels cars and planes, powers industry and heats homes.The prize winners were awarded £1 million each and will benefit from a network of professional and technical support to scale their environmental solutions to repair our planet and accelerate their impact.Reem Al Hashimy, UAE Minister of State for International Cooperation and director-general, Expo 2020 Dubai, said, “As a Global Alliance Founding Partner of the Earthshot Prize – alongside DP World, Expo 2020’s Global Trade Partner – we warmly congratulate its first five worthy winners. These inspirational projects reflect perfectly the theme and purpose of Expo 2020, ‘Connecting Minds, Creating the Future’, and will help to catalyse a worldwide movement during a crucial decade of action to repair our planet. We cannot wait to see how winning the Earthshot Prize will enable them to continue their incredible work, as we collectively push towards the goal of creating a better world.”Costa Rica was awarded the prize for its Payments for Environmental Services Programme in the prize’s Protect and Restore Nature category. The programme – the first scheme of its type in the country and the region – promotes forest ecosystem conservation and combats land degradation.William Reuben, commissioner-general of the Costa Rica Pavilion at Expo 2020 Dubai, said: “We are honoured to be receiving this award in recognition of Costa Rica’s contribution to preserving the environment and our innovative eco-services.“Costa Rica’s Payments for Environmental Services Programme pays small farmers to protect forests, plant trees, and restore ecosystems. It has been operating for many years and has been responsible for remarkable achievements in reverting deforestation.“As a result of the programme, 53 per cent of Costa Rica’s territory is now covered by forest, which is an increase from 32 per cent two decades ago. The programme pays small farmers to plant trees in the forest-free areas of their farms, which has led to a reversion of the deforestation trend. A total of 18,000 families have received support through the programme.“Added to this is another innovative initiative, which is eco-tourism. Costa Rica has a system of national conservation areas that have been important to making Costa Rica into an international eco-tourism destination. By offering accommodation to tourists, small farmers involved in the programme get an additional source of income.”The five prize winners were chosen by a panel of 15 eminent judges, including broadcaster Sir David Attenborough, actress Cate Blanchett and singer Shakira. Each year for the next decade, the prize will award £1 million apiece to five projects that are working to find solutions to the planet's environmental problems.Reuben said visitors to the Costa Rica Pavilion will be able to learn about the prize-winning programme and other environmental initiatives. He said: “We appreciate Expo 2020 Dubai’s support for the Earthshot Prize and welcome the technical support of Expo and the UAE Government has been key to ensuring our participation in this global event.”Other prize winners in their respective categories were:>> Takachar, India (Clean Our Air) for a portable machine that turns agricultural waste into fertiliser, which avoids farmers burning their fields and causing air pollution>> Coral Vita, Bahamas (Revive Our Oceans) for a project that uses special tanks to make coral grow up to 50 times faster than traditional methods>> The City of Milan Food Waste Hubs, Italy (Build a Waste-Free World) for an initiative that collects unused food and redistributes it to people who need it most>  AEM Electrolyser, Thailand/Germany/Italy (Fix Our Climate) for technology that uses renewable energy to split water into hydrogen and oxygen – the emission-free hydrogen gas can then be used as fuelExpo 2020Decree extends the terms of the Expo 2020 Dubai Preparatory Committee, and the Expo 2020 Dubai Bureau and its Director GeneralExpo 2020Expo 2020The mega fair was committed to empowering women, who accounted for 65 percent of Emirati citizens that worked at the eventExpo 2020Expo 2020The pavilion welcomed almost 200,000 visitors during Expo 2020 Dubai.Expo 2020Expo 20203.5 million food shipments were imported from 114 countries for world fairExpo 2020Expo 2020Dr. Thani bin Ahmed Al Zeyoudi says it helped UAE establish partnerships with other countries and opened it up to international marketsExpo 2020Expo 2020Patrick Njoroge Wachira, arguably the world’s youngest CEO, seeks to spread the concept of STEM beyond his native countryExpo 2020Expo 2020The gates were opened 182 times over the past six months Expo 2020Expo 2020The mega-fair came to an end in the early hours of Friday, March 31Expo 2020"
https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/net-zero-goal-india-focused-on-now-analysts/cid/1836872,"India’s refusal until Monday to announce a target year when it would attain net-zero emissions — release only as much of Earth-warming greenhouse gas emissions as it removes — had  caused consternation ahead of the Glasgow climate conference that opened on Sunday. Some scientists and policy makers view the Glasgow meeting as the most consequential since the 2015 Paris conference. Ahead of the conference, 49 countries and the European Union (EU) have pledged a net-zero target amid what scientists believe is an unavoidable goal of steering the global economy towards net-zero emissions. India, the fourth largest greenhouse gas emitter after China, the US, and the EU, might appear to be among the bad guys. But two veteran climate policy analysts argue that India’s position is not only well-founded in science and equity but focuses on the challenge of reducing current emissions now rather than on debates on a target year decades in the future. Anand Patwardhan, professor of public policy at the University of Maryland in the US, and Jayant Mauskar, a former Indian civil servant and lead climate change negotiator for India explain to The Telegraph why they believe the current debate on net-zero is a red herring, a dangerous distraction.Q: Why are some describing the Glasgow climate conference that started on Sunday as the most consequential after the 2015 Paris meeting?A. Every country hosting the (climate) conference wants to leave behind a legacy. However, this conference takes on added significance. It comes months after the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change working group report painted an alarming picture of future climate change. It also comes at a time when countries are being encouraged to submit updated nationally determined contributions, or climate pledges, subsequent to their first submissions under the Paris agreement. It represents a real test of the underlying premise of the “pledge-and-review” architecture of the Paris Agreement — that over time, countries will continue to ratchet up their ambitions, and that this mechanism could be an effective replacement for the earlier determined targets and timetables under the earlier Kyoto agreement that have fallen by the wayside.Q: The EU and 49 countries have pledged net-zero emissions by specific target years, albeit distant. Surely, for India too, net-zero emissions are important.A: India continues to demonstrate a low carbon development pathway in action even while tackling its high vulnerability to current climate variability on which the impacts of global warming are superposed. Even today, India’s per capita emissions are well below those of comparable developing countries and the developed world. While China’s net zero target of 2060 is very welcome, the reality is that China’s per capita emissions are already about four times that of India’s and by the time China’s emissions are expected to peak in 2030, Chinese per capita emissions will be 2.3 times India’s. If India were to follow a similar emissions trajectory, Indian emissions would not peak until 2050 and would not reach net-zero until 2087.  The reality is that India is already on a much lower carbon emission pathway consistent with national circumstances and development goals.We would argue that India’s pledge should not only signal ambition but base it on a realistic and equitable pathway of getting there. Signalling ambition is possible without jumping on the net-zero bandwagon but is perhaps better illustrated through markers laid out in India’s current nationally determined climate actions — an economy-wide emissions intensity target, ambitious policies for a move away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy sources, energy efficiency and land use change and forestry.  The same should apply for other countries too — rather than take recourse to targets far in the future, present ambitious actions today that will actually make a future net-zero target credible and achievable.Q: By when should the developed countries ideally reach net zero?A: Considering their historical emissions and the available carbon budget, equity requires that the US should have aimed for a net-zero emissions target by 2025 and the European Union by 2033. Equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities pin the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change and cannot simply be papered over. If there is a lack of ambition — it rests more squarely on the developed countries than on the developing countries.Q: Is global net zero by 2050 then achievable?A: A global net zero by 2050 is needed. But the way it needs to be achieved is through a global deal that respects common but differentiated responsibilities — the concept that the largest historical emitters — the developed countries — need to do more and faster than the developing countries. Not only does this imply differentiated net-zero timetables with developed countries striving for net zero well before 2050, but also large finance and technology transfers to help developing countries bend the emissions curve. A pledge of US$ 100 billion per year by 2020 had been made. But even that has not been achieved yet.Q: What would you view as a satisfactory outcome from the Glasgow conference?A: The conference would do well to focus on finance and technology transfers needed to achieve a low-carbon trajectory for the developing world within this decade, instead of being distracted by the net-zero red herring, which obscures historical burdens and ignores future development needs. What matters for global climate is not just the year when emissions reach net zero, but rather the full trajectory of emissions. The higher and the more delayed the emissions peak, the more stringent and difficult the mitigation challenge. If the emissions curve is not bent quickly through technology transfers and finance, the inexorable calculus of the carbon budget will lead to the outcomes we are so desperately trying to avoid."

We released WoodMac’s latest Energy Transition Outlook (ETO) last week. The analysis projects global energy demand and supply across all sectors through to 2050. It’s a bottom-up, integrated model: energy demand forecast by sector for every country; and the supply of energy, metals and bulk commodities to meet it sourced from our asset database.Chart shows wind and solar grow three times faster than oil but hydrocarbons retain 70% of energy demand by 2050The ETO shows what happens if COP26 fails to lay down the law on collective goals and actions to tackle climate change. The ETO assumes that policy and technology continue to ‘evolve’ much as they are doing now. Nations, industries and people strive to reduce emissions and are successful up to a point. But it’s patchy – the easier gains are made, the tougher ones lag.The result? Efforts to slow down global warming aren’t big enough or fast enough. Our Energy Transition team helped me pick out the ETO’s main insights and implications.First, the outcome of the ETO is a 2.5 °C to 2.7 °C pathway. The global economic recovery will lead to energy-related CO2 emissions not falling but rising over the next five years to a new high of 34 Bt in 2026, just above the 2019 peak. Slow penetration by low-carbon fuels and new technologies means that emissions are still 25 Bt by 2050, a decline of just 9 Bt from the peak. It’s a far cry from the net zero 2050 ambition. Coincidentally, the ETO’s pathway is closely in line with the 2.7 °C prognosis in the UN Emissions Gap report released this week, albeit for different reasons.The risks of failing to deliver the Paris Agreement’s goal of ‘well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C’ are well documented, as is the impact that our power generation, production methods, agriculture and consumption patterns have on the climate system.Second, in the ETO, the world relies on fossil fuels for decades to come. Hydrocarbons are persistent – while their share of the global energy mix falls, it is still 70% in 2050, marginally down from 80% today. Oil demand plateaus and begins a slow decline in the mid-2030s; gas demand in contrast continues to increase into the 2040s fuelled by Asian economic growth. Investment in oil and gas will have to be sustained, with US$12 trillion spent on new supply through 2050.In the ETO, the world relies on fossil fuels for decades to come.Third, roll-out of the suite of low-carbon technologies is slow. There will be great successes as the world electrifies – solar and wind’s share of global power rises from 10% today to 48% by 2050. Yet the transition in power also brings major challenges, among them grid reliability and price volatility in renewables-dominated systems, and the cost of decarbonising the ‘final 30%’ of expensive generation that still relies on coal and gas.Battery costs break through the magic US$100/kWh barrier in 2024, enabling electric vehicles (EVs) to be competitive. The global stock of EVs reaches 877 million by 2050, 50% of the total light vehicle stock. EVs, along with other low-carbon transport vehicles, displace 22 million b/d of oil demand by 2050 – assuming the required US$5 trillion of investment in EV charging happens.The trajectory of green hydrogen costs mirrors that of renewables over the last decade, falling 75% by 2050; blue hydrogen, a more pedestrian 8%. Industrial-scale hydrogen capacity doesn’t arrive until the 2040s. It’s a similar story for carbon capture and storage capacity.There is still plenty of growth in low-carbon technologies and much opportunity for investment. We estimate US$32 trillion of spend through 2050 on these technologies and the infrastructure to support them in the ETO. The opportunity, though, would be substantially bigger in a 2.0 °C or lower pathway. The technologies of the transition, most of them at least, are already there awaiting development and commercialisation.

                                Clear skies. Low around 20F. Winds SSW at 5 to 10 mph. Updated: October 24, 2022 @ 11:12 pmExample of solar arrays similar to ones KCEC is installing around Taos County.With the completion of Kit Carson Electric Cooperative's newest solar array, Taos County’s reputation as a center for clean energy continues to grow. The ribbon cutting ceremony for the 3-megawatt array, adjacent to the Taos Wastewater Treatment facility in Ranchos de Taos, is scheduled for 10 a.m. this Friday (Oct. 29). The new array was constructed in partnership with the town of Taos, which leased 30 acres of land for the project. According to Luis Reyes Jr., chief executive officer of Kit Carson Electric Cooperative (KCEC), the ribbon-cutting event will honor the integral partnerships involved in the process, as well as the co-op’s commitment to combating the effects of climate change. “We want to celebrate,” said Reyes. “We’re advancing our renewable energy goals. We’re doing it with local labor. We’re doing it with local partnerships. And we’re addressing both energy issues and climate change issues ... We did it because it’s the right thing to do.”Reyes hopes that Friday’s ceremony will also help accentuate the good that’s happening in the community. In the wake of increasing global temperatures and rising costs of everything from food to natural gas, it can be easy to focus on the negatives, Reyes says. But KCEC holds the view that, “there are some really positive things going on in the community.”Saving the planet, and your walletTaos County is a leader in clean energy, but the push toward renewables in recent years spans the globe. The world’s most popular renewable, solar power, is more affordable and more prevalent in the U.S. than ever before. More than 3 percent of the nation’s power now comes from solar energy, according to a report from the Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy. On both a national and local scale, an increased reliance on solar energy equates to greater cost savings for consumers. As for costs at the consumer level, renewable energy “starts to lower them, and starts to fix them,” says Reyes. According to him, the current cost of power in the region from all sources is 6.5 cents per kilowatt. With the arrays, the cost drops to between 5.5 and 5.7 cents. That reduced rate is expected to hold steady for 25 years, or the life expectancy of the new array. Solar energy also helps mitigate the uncertainty that often surrounds energy prices, which can vary significantly depending on a variety of factors. In 2021, for instance, the price of natural gas increased, and electricity costs have risen alongside it. “The more we fix, then the more certainty you have, and then we kind of buffer the fluctuations in price,” said Reyes. “And little by little, incrementally, with partnerships, you start to really build a renewable energy infrastructure.”Solar energy at the heart of TaosCloudy days and a lack of storage facilities are among solar’s biggest drawbacks, but those are a small price to pay for greater certainty in power supply and cost. In addition, KCEC is working to address those potential issues within the local community.Residents of Los Cordovas and Ranchos, who live close to the new array, will soon “start to see more solar during the day to meet their needs, which means we become less and less dependent on fossil fuel resources,” said Reyes.For its part, KCEC is working toward its goal of reaching 100 percent daytime renewable energy by 2022, as well as increasing its storage capacity. Construction of the 15 megawatt Taos Mesa array is now underway near the Taos Airport.With that project, all of Taos County – to include Taos Canyon and Taos Mesa – becomes all daytime solar, says Reyes, and the region will also have battery backup for days with minimal sunshine. “There really isn’t any downside [to solar energy],” said Reyes. “At least for a community like us, who really love the outdoors.” In the end, Reyes believes that sustainable actions can build stronger communities. “You start to build a mindset. Kind of the soul of the community is to be sustainable and clean. And we don’t just talk about it. We actually have arrays and partnerships … Pretty soon, it [sustainability] becomes the rule, not the exception.”

https://www.vvdailypress.com/story/news/environment/2021/11/10/california-drought-taking-toll-migrating-birds-bird-migration-map-us-map-pacific-flyway-climate/6374237001/,"It says something about the complexity of California’s water crisis that there are so many actors in the state’s water wars, all clamoring for more. Nature, alone, is silent in this fight, relying on others to speak on behalf of the welfare of wildlife and waterways.Across the state, biologists, farmers and hunters are lending nature a helping hand. It’s sometimes an extreme intervention: trucking young salmon when drought shrinks rivers. But this year these lifelines aren’t enough. Migratory birds — protected by state and national laws and an international treaty — are suffering mightily during this drought, even more quickly than they did during the last major dry spell, which lasted five years and ended in early 2017.California is the most critical link in the 4,000-mile-long Pacific Flyway, a route along the West Coast where millions of birds shuttle between their summer and winter homes. It’s an arduous journey, hopscotching from wetlands and waterways, allowing birds to rest and refuel, shoring up strength for their trip.Wildlife experts say this year’s severe drought has uncoupled that connectivity. Normal routes — long imprinted in migrating birds’ navigation systems — have gone haywire.The great dryness has eliminated many of the flyway’s rest stops in California — particularly in the far north Klamath region — forcing ducks, geese, eagles, herons and other traveling birds to stay aloft and keep looking. Biologists in Northern California and Oregon say they are tracking flocks deviating far off established flight paths, seeking water where there is little. Experts say evidence is already emerging a year into this drought that their labored journey is weakening and stressing birds that struggle to find wetlands along their journey to rest and feed.This year is the driest on record in the Lower Klamath Basin, a lush region of marshes and streams that straddles the Oregon-California border. The refuges there are “almost completely dry,” said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service spokesperson Susan Sawyer.As a result, nearly all of the ducks have vanished. A recent aerial survey of the vast refuge showed about 34,000 ducks this year compared to 1.5 million in 1948; nearby Tule Lake refuge had only about 30,000 ducks in the survey, down from 3.5 million.In the span of a few human generations, even in years of plentiful rain, 90% of California’s wetlands have disappeared to development and agriculture, so migrating birds are especially vulnerable to prolonged droughts. “The journey, from the human perspective, is enormous,” said Andrew Farnsworth, who researches bird migration at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. “It requires a lot of energy. Some start in Alaska. Flights of 4,000 miles are absolutely quite common, and they will fly nonstop for a few days. Having the resources they need is critically important.”Melanie Weaver, waterfowl coordinator for the state Department of Fish and Wildlife, has confidence in the ability of migrating birds to adapt, saying “ducks and geese are wired to go through drought. They don’t fall out of the sky. They have wings, they move where food and water is.”But the widespread nature of this drought throughout the West, and its severity and potential duration, may challenge even the most resilient wildlife.“I’m concerned that we are not going to see the populations come back,” Weaver said. “This drought is bad. The odds are against us.”Even recent winter storms — which dumped rain across the north and central parts of the state and swelled some rivers and streams — made no dent to ease California’s drought, wetlands loss or water shortage.Resting and feeding spots at wildlife refuges are overcrowded this year, which can foster spikes in the infectious or water-borne illnesses spread by close quarters. Avian botulism and cholera, present even in wet years, spike in arid times. A botulism outbreak in the lower Klamath Basin last year killed an estimated 60,000 birds, likely many more.So far the Klamath refuges have not experienced a severe disease outbreak like the one that took place last year. “But the spring could be a different story if birds leave the Central Valley early and return to the Klamath where there is little to no available habitat,” Sawyer said.Klamath’s marshes, streams and grasslands provide vital stops during birds’  long journeys — more than 80% of migratory birds on the Pacific Flyway use them as a stopover in spring and fall. But the region has been one of the hardest hit in this year’s statewide drought.Instances of young birds being “stranded” are amplified during drought. Dabbling ducks, which includes mallards and pintails, nest in upland areas and must walk to water sources. During dry periods those marches can be too long for young birds that have no flight feathers so they can’t survive. Biologists say this happens all over the state, even in normal years, but is more common during drought.While the Klamath region is the hardest hit, wetlands farther south on the flyway are in bad shape, too. At the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge, the October bird count is not encouraging. By the third week in October last year, the rough waterfowl count was nearly 800,000 birds. This year, it was 600,000.And, to illustrate how the intensity of this drought is coming sooner than the last: The refuge’s geese population today is less than half than it was for the same month in 2015, which was the region’s worst year during the last drought.Biologists talk about the resilience of birds, hard-wired to just keep pushing on, but there is little good news now and even less for the near future. The National Audubon Society estimates that two-thirds of North American birds are at increasing risk of extinction because of climate change.That vulnerability is repeated around the world: Only 9% of the planet’s migratory birds have protected areas along their routes, and loss of habitat and climate change is “a contributing factor to the decline of more than half of the migratory bird species across all major flyways in the last 30 years.”Migrating birds, which a century ago filled the sky and blotted out the sun during trips along California’s long spine, need help.To make the state more hospitable to migrating birds during the drought, state and federal programs are paying farmers to keep water on their fields. The state Department of Water Resources invested $8 million this fall. In the northern end of the Central Valley, agricultural land is flooded and managed as migratory bird habitat for exhausted annual travelers flapping in from as far away as Alaska and Russia.But the amount of water from rivers and lakes allocated for wildlife refuges has been cut back substantially this year. The Lower Klamath Refuge has been operating with half its water allocations from rivers and streams since 2006, but this year has been devastating: It received less than 1% of its allocations.With the loss of more than 99% of its wetlands, few chicks were born in the refuge this year. Most birds didn’t bother stopping there to nest, moving instead to refuges the Sacramento area, which received 75% of their usual water allocation.“This past summer there was extremely reduced waterfowl reproduction on the (Klamath) refuge due to the very limited available habitat,” Sawyer said.The juvenile golden eagle, tagged as No. 2-21-0824, lay splayed on his back on a stainless-steel necropsy table at the state Wildlife Health Laboratory north of Sacramento. He had been discovered dead in Bakersfield, on the ground and emaciated, and taken to a wildlife rescue organization. His carcass was placed in a black trash bag, frozen and sent by FedEx to Krysta Rogers, head of avian investigations for the state fish and wildlife agency.Rogers’ job is to discover what caused the young bird’s death. She selected large pruning shears, the sort gardeners might use to lop off a large tree branch. With a loud crack, she snapped the bird’s femur, setting aside a section of bone for further analysis.Methodically examining the carcass, Rogers knew that the bird was not among the uncounted animals to succumb to drought-related causes. Instead, the young bird’s death was a case of bad housekeeping. It’s likely that the eagle’s parents brought home meals of especially fatty squirrels, Rogers said. The fat coated the bird’s wings, rendering it unable to fly. In a final blow, it’s possible that his nest-mate pushed him out of the family home to keep the food to itself.Ascribing a death to drought is a complex puzzle to solve, when nature offers so many ways to die. “It’s not often a direct, causative thing,” Rogers said, still hunched over the bird. “But we can say that in some cases it (drought) is a contributing factor” to bird deaths.What drought does is render the already precarious existence for wildlife all the more dicey.When normal weather patterns are off kilter, even in a small way, the impact on birds and their environment can be profound. Birds can die during extreme heat events that sometimes accompany drought.  That happened this spring and summer, with young barn owls dying of heat stress when sheltering in nesting boxes that people built in their yards in Contra Costa, Humboldt, Marin, San Diego, Stanislaus, Yolo and Los Angeles counties.Water quality problems can occur when well-meaning people maintain backyard bird baths with stagnant, non-circulating water that speeds the spread of parasites. Disease can be spread when raptors or other animals prey on sick birds.“Streams and creeks are not running like they typically would,” Rogers said. “Birds and other animals rely more heavily on artificial sources of water and food. I expect to see disease outbreaks at bird feeders and artificial sources of water such as bird baths and fountains.”State wildlife officials can’t say with assurance that populations of migratory birds have declined; nearly two years of COVID-19 has grounded bird survey flights and this year’s winter migration has months to go. But they have the last drought to go by, and that suggests migrating birds are in for trouble.Scientists expect current data to mirror the declines during the height of the last drought. California’s population of breeding ducks in 2015 fell 30% compared to 2014, according to a U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife survey. “That didn’t surprise us,” said Weaver, of the state wildlife agency, who also sits on the Pacific Flyway Council. “Why breed when your habitat isn’t there? Local populations decline. They recover when conditions improve.”Still, she said, the endless cycles of drought throughout the West, combined with drastic wetlands loss, could mean that migratory bird populations may not ever return to historic numbers. In normal years, when water is plentiful and affordable, some 270,000 acres of winter rice fields in the Sacramento Valley are lightly flooded and available to receive wintering shorebirds, such as white faced ibis, great blue herons and many varieties of geese and ducks. The Central Valley, with its usual bounty of food and space, supports 30% of the shorebirds and 60% of the ducks and geese in the entire Pacific Flyway, nearly 3 million ducks, 1 million geese and a half-million shorebirds overwintering annually.Given the severe drought conditions and paucity of available water, there is substantially less habitat for those flocks this year. Luke Matthews, a biologist with the California Rice Commission, said his group estimates there are only 60,000 acres of flooded rice land this year. Adding the acreage supported by various state and private conservation programs brings the total agricultural winter habitat to just over 100,000 acres, Matthews said.Still, from the perspective of hungry, exhausted migratory birds, the Sacramento Valley must appear from the air like a spa retreat featuring an all-you-can-eat buffet.Once settled, the birds will derive 50% of their diet from rice left on the ground after the fall harvest. As much as 300 pounds of rice per acre is available to birds after the crop is harvested.Agricultural lands have proved critical for filling in the gaps from California’s wetlands loss. Dense, clay soil is nearly impermeable – a shallow vessel of water ideal for growing rice and hosting birds. Since air pollution concerns almost ended the practice of burning off rice straw after harvest, flooding harvested fields benefit both farmer and bird: While feeding in the fields, tiny bird feet and stomping geese churn and aerate soils, helping rice straw decompose, preparing the land for the next season’s crop.A disparate collection of agencies and private groups is funding “pop-up wetlands.” Farmers are increasingly raising their hands to host wetlands, seeing a dual benefit: For rice farmers, winter flooding makes financial sense but also appeals to those with a conservation mindset.“We grow two crops: We grow rice and we grow birds,” said Nicole Montna Van Vleck, president of Montna Farms in Yuba City.Flooded fields on Montna Van Vleck’s sprawling 5,000-acre farm look like shallow kiddie pools. Some paddocks are dark with thousands of resting birds, with white molting-season feathers collected around the edges like a bathtub ring.“Every season for me is awe-inspiring,” she said, surveying the flat expanse of water and birds. “You can almost imagine what it was like when this was a natural floodplain, when you get out here and see these ricelands work. We’ve created this ecosystem for them. There’s plenty of food for them. I never get tired of it.”One conservation program, called BirdReturns, was launched during the last drought and is operated in part by Audubon California, the Nature Conservancy and Point Blue Conservation Science. It creates a marketplace for private landowners to provide shallow flooding, mostly for shorebirds.A similar program, called Bid4Birds, operated by the California Ricelands Waterbird Foundation, encourages rice farmers to participate in a marketplace where they are compensated for the cost of leaving water on their land for migratory birds.The BirdReturns program has a goal of creating an additional 100,000 acres of habitat available every year, said Rodd Kelsey, The Nature Conservancy’s lead scientist on the project. Despite the gains made since its inception in 2014, “this drought is much worse,” Kelsey said. Rice farmers “will tell you that the water situation is something they have not seen since the late ’70s drought.”Paul Buttner, California Ricelands Waterbird Foundation’s executive director, called the outlook “really, really dismal.”The severity of the last drought drove once-bickering sides into collaborative problem-solving. The drought was a “stark and shocking wakeup call,” prompting bird groups, farmers, duck hunting clubs and state and federal wildlife managers to begin conversations, said Meghan Hertel, Audubon California’s director of land and water conservation.More than half of the wetlands in the Sacramento Valley are privately owned, operated by duck clubs established for bird hunting. Land managers regularly called each other to track birds on the move, Hertel said. “They’d say, ‘Hey I’ve got 100,000 snow geese coming your way, hold on to your water.”Steering an SUV through the slanting afternoon light at the Sacramento River National Wildlife Refuge, Craig Isola keeps a pair of binoculars handy. As deputy manager, Isola is trying to get a fix on how this drought might play out there.The birds, he said, are arriving at the refuge hungry as they couldn’t find wetlands or food  during their journey south.“We are seeing birds show up earlier here because of lack of water in the north, in the Klamath Basin,” he said. “Historically birds will stage and hold up in the Klamath Valley before flying down to Sacramento. But when there’s nothing to the north, they move south. The birds are coming in hungry.”The Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, operated by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, is a string of five managed wetlands, seasonal pools and streams spread over 39,000 acres about an hour’s drive north of Sacramento. Established in 1937, the refuge provides critical wintering habitat for the Pacific Flyway’s birds.  Already, in October, tens of thousands of birds were scattered across the 10,000-acre Sacramento River Refuge, which is receiving water from Lake Shasta, via the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, into the rain-starved marshes to accommodate the early arrivals. The refuge is operating on 75% of its usual water allocation, a generous amount compared to less than 1% at the Lower Klamath refuge and 16% at the Klamath region’s Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge.The refuge’s water grass and smartweed provide protein and fats to augment the carbohydrates birds get from the nearby rice farms. The flocks loaf in the refuge during the day and in the evening make their way to pick through the fields, where most of the rice is already harvested. It’s the time of day when the distant boom-boom of cannons echoes, fired off by growers to scare birds away from farms that have yet to harvest.The newly arrived birds are jumpy, Isola said, not yet settled into their surroundings. Dusk is a restless time at the refuge, with a constant soundtrack of chittering and squeaking. Even a hint of a raptor gliding overhead causes an explosion of wings and water as flocks take to the air. Bald eagles and peregrine Falcons won’t attack migratory birds while they are flying. Wildlife managers have an obligation to support migrating birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and in some cases state and federal endangered species laws. Beyond that legal charge, the animals’ health is a window into California’s environmental stewardship.“Wildlife are the ultimate indicators on how this land is doing,” Isola said. “They represent the idea of maintaining biodiversity and the ability to evolve into the future, for all of us.”"

With numerous studies documenting air pollution's link to heart-related illness and death, two leading American physicians are calling on their peers to begin screening patients for exposure to indoor and outdoor air pollution and recommending interventions in order to limit exposure and improve cardiovascular health, the researchers write in the New England Journal of Medicine.
                                                




 In addition, governments have a primary responsibility, as stewards of public health, to adopt technologies and regulations that reduce air pollution—measures that will also contribute to efforts to combat climate change, write Philip J. Landrigan, MD, director of the Global Public Health and the Common Good Program at Boston College, and Sanjay Rajagopalan, MD, chief of cardiovascular medicine at UH Harrington Heart & Vascular Institute, the Herman K. Hellerstein, MD, Chair in Cardiovascular Research, and director of the Case Cardiovascular Research Institute at the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine.
Cardiovascular diseases are the world's leading cause of death and disability, responsible for 18.6 million deaths worldwide in 2019, including 957,000 deaths in the United States. That same year, an estimated 5.5 million cardiovascular deaths were linked to air pollution—including 200,000 deaths in the United States, though the authors note that number could be up to ten times higher, based on a number of studies.
The grim statistics illustrate that it is now necessary for physicians, who have long addressed heart health from standpoints of nutrition, diet, smoking and exercise, to play a greater role helping patients recognize their risk factors for exposure to pollutants and recommending evidence-based strategies in response, the co-authors argue.
""The first step in preventing pollution-related cardiovascular disease is to overcome neglect of pollution in disease prevention programs, medical education, and clinical practice and acknowledge that pollution is a major, potentially preventable risk factor for cardiovascular disease,"" Landrigan and Rajagopalan write in the journal.
In addition to obtaining patient histories of pollution exposure, doctors can provide guidance on pollution avoidance. They might recommend minimizing exercise on ""bad air"" days, avoiding exposure on the job, and avoiding the use of pollution-emitting devices—from fireplaces to incense sticks. Preventative recommendations could include the use of facemasks, in-home air cleaners, and air conditioning.

                    The researchers note many ways in which individual physicians can bring the environmental lens to their patients. “Physicians can qualitatively assess exposure risk in patients when relevant, assess individual susceptibility, and provide guidance on pollution avoidance,” said Dr. Rajagopalan.

                    The team explains that physicians can take collective action through professional societies to persuade elected officials to reduce pollution levels for all patients across the United States. They emphasize that the most effective of these actions will be a massive, rapid shift away from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy, with the added benefit of slowing the rate of climate change.

""What has been missing from this whole conversation about cardiovascular disease is the impact of environmental factors outside of an individual's control,"" said Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist whose pioneering work led to the removal of lead from gasoline. ""It is time to bring these issues into the conversation.""






Landrigan, director of Boston College's Global Observatory on Pollution and Health, added ""The scientific knowledge is not brand new. It has been recognized for at least a decade that air pollution and lead are important causes for heart disease and stroke. However, that scientific knowledge hasn't yet translated to clinical practice in office, hospital at bedside. We think it is time for that to change. We are hoping this will change the practice of individual doctors and NPs, and that it will change the advice that prominent professional organizations give to their members and the public.""
In addition to the call to action for their fellow physicians, Landrigan and Rajagopalan want to bring the issue of pollution to the attention of the world's leading medical, health, and physician associations to enlist their members in the effort to control pollution. The American Heart Association has already issued guidance on steps individuals can take to protect themselves from air pollution, they note.
But the global scale of the problem is so great that physicians and health care providers cannot be expected to resolve it on their own, the physicians say. Governments, currently grappling with the global response to climate change at the COP26 meetings in Glasgow, Scotland, can use those same efforts to improve cardiovascular health.
""An enduring reduction in pollution-related cardiovascular disease will require more than changing individual behaviors,"" they write in the journal. ""It will necessitate widescale control of pollution at its sources. The most effective strategy for achieving this goal is a rapid, government-supported transition from all fossil fuels—coal, gas, and oil—to clean, renewable energy. Household air pollution in low-income countries is most effectively controlled by providing poor families with affordable access to cleaner fuels.""
It will take government action to lead the way, they argue: ""Lasting prevention of pollution-related cardiovascular disease can be achieved only through government-supported interventions on a societal scale that control pollution at its source and encourage a rapid transition to clean energy.""

Governments, currently grappling with the global response to climate change at the COP26 meetings in Glasgow, Scotland, can use those same efforts to improve cardiovascular health.""An enduring reduction in pollution-related cardiovascular disease will require more than changing individual behaviors,"" they write in the journal. ""It will necessitate widescale control of pollution at its sources. The most effective strategy for achieving this goal is a rapid, government-supported transition from all fossil fuels—coal, gas, and oil—to clean, renewable energy. Household air pollution in low-income countries is most effectively controlled by providing poor families with affordable access to cleaner fuels.""It will take government action to lead the way, they argue: ""Lasting prevention of pollution-related cardiovascular disease can be achieved only through government-supported interventions on a societal scale that control pollution at its source and encourage a rapid transition to clean energy.""

https://kdat.com/waterloo-muscatine-and-burlington-have-most-cancer-causing-air-pollution-in-iowa/,"On November 2 of this year, Al Shaw, Lylla Younes, and Ava Kofman came together for projects.propublica.org to put together a report of The Most Detailed Map of Cancer-Causing Industrial Air Pollution in the U.S.According to the site,ProPublica’s analysis of five years of modeled EPA data identified more than 1,000 toxic hot spots across the country and found that an estimated 250,000 people living in them may be exposed to levels of excess cancer risk that the EPA deems unacceptable.Not so surprisingly, Iowa was not a state that held a plethora of cities with major, cancer-causing pollution filling the air. Cities and states like Port Arthur, Texas, Hawesville, Kentucky, and Radford, Virginia were listed towards the top.The Hawkeye State is not without its problems, though. Small towns like Corning, Lenox, Pella, and Newton are above the EPA's recommended level of risk.While there were other areas of concern in the state, Waterloo, Muscatine, and Burlington were the key points of highest danger when it comes to air-pollution caused cancer.Waterloo's hot spot near John Deere Waterloo Works Drivetrain Operations and Foundry leaves residents with a 1 in 2,900 chance of getting some form of cancer over their lifetime. Per the site, this specific industrial area ""contributes 99.9% of the estimated excess cancer risk there."" Chromium, Chromium compounds, Benzene and others carcinogens are the prevalent pollutants.For the area near Muscatine, Harsco Metals contributes 99.9% of the estimated cancer risk, leaving those in there with a 1 in 3,400 chance. Chromium and Nickel compounds are the known pollutants. In and around Burlington, there are several places that have added to the issue over the last five years. Modern Welding Co. of Iowa Inc. puts 99.6% of the contaminants in the air. though. Chromium and Nickel are the problem factors. Burlington's risk has significantly dropped, though. Starting in 2016 the risk dropped significantly. ProPublica did not specific as to why the air pollutants dropped here, but the site did have this to say:The risk within a hot spot varies widely based on weather patterns and proximity to facilities. Some facilities that contribute to the risk here may be in other nearby hot spots."

During the pursuit, he tossed a backpack of illegal drugs out of the window, which was later recovered.Officers eventually forced Norman to the right lane, where he stopped and jumped out of the car, running into the woods.When firefighters put out the flames, they discovered the body of his 19-month-old daughter in the car. An autopsy revealed she died from burns and acute carbon monoxide poisoning.Norman was taken into custody a few hours later and told police he thought they would be able to save his daughter.He pleaded guilty to charges of homicide by child abuse, failure to stop for a blue light and siren, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, trafficking methamphetamine and possession of with intent to distribute amphetamine, possession of oxycodone, and possession of Xanax.Authorities said that he must serve 85% of his sentence to be eligible for parole."

Subscribe here: thehill.com/newsletter-signUp.Today we’re looking at common ground between China and the U.S. at the COP26 summit, a draft out of the summit calling for faster fossil fuel phaseouts, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) defending the United States’ climate leadershipFor The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Write to us with tips: rfrazin@thehill.com and zbudryk@thehill.com. Follow us on Twitter: @RachelFrazin and @BudrykZack.Let’s jump in.  US, China release joint climate statementIn separate press conferences on Wednesday during a United Nations climate summit in Glasgow, Scotland, each country’s climate envoy announced the agreement, a copy of which was later released by the State Department.The statement said that the two sides plan to cooperate on regulations relating to cutting the release of planet-warming gases this decade, policies to encourage electrification of parts of the economy that use energy, and deployment of technology that captures emissions when fossil fuels are burned or pulled them from the air. These technologies, which include carbon capture and storage, can be controversial, as past projects have had cost and mechanical issues, and they can prolong fossil fuel use.What else? It also said they plan to collaborate on reducing emissions of a gas called methane, which is a more powerful climate-warmer than carbon dioxide and comes from activities including oil and gas development and agriculture.As the U.S. has recently released its own strategy for taking on methane, the agreement said that China will likewise develop a national plan for methane.The two countries also say they’ll develop additional measures both nationally and subnationally, and will meet during the first half of next year on methane standards for fossil fuels and landfills and incentive programs for agriculture.Kerry speaks out: U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told reporters that the agreement “makes a statement about the imperative” for the world’s top two emitters to cooperate.  “It commits to a series of important actions, not in the long term, not in the future, but now,” Kerry added.   And he praised the action on methane, noting that it has been identified as “the single fastest and most effective way to limit warming.”   Methane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period and even more powerful in the short term, so experts have pointed to reductions in this gas as a rapid way to lessen the planet’s warming.Read more about the joint statement here. A MESSAGE FROM EXXONMOBIL  Here’s how we’re supporting the Global Methane PledgeExxonMobil supports reducing methane emissions by 30% by the year 2030, in line with the Global Methane Pledge. We are working to reduce methane emissions, and encourage others in and out of our industry to join. Learn more.  Draft calls for phaseout of coal, fossil subsidiesA draft agreement put forward by the president of the United Nations global climate summit calls for countries to accelerate the phaseout of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels. The draft, which is subject to change amid negotiations, represents a more ambitious call than expected since a previous “non-paper” did not mention fossil fuels. Still, it does not set a firm timeline for the phaseouts, and such policies could be contentious domestically in countries like the U.S.The story so far:  During the conference, 18 countries said for the first time that they would phase out coal, with major economies ending their use in the 2030s and others ending it in the 2040s. The U.S. did not join them.When it’s burned, coal adds more planet-warming carbon dioxide to the atmosphere than other fossil fuels like oil and gas.The new draft also calls for countries to create and release proposed pathways toward achieving net-zero emissions by or around the middle of the century in order to limit warming.This too, could be contentious as a group of countries that includes China and India recently wrote that calls for net-zero by 2050 could exacerbate inequality between developed and developing nations.Asked what the most contentious issues would be and whether the coal language would ultimately make it in, COP26 President Alok Sharma did not give a specific answer.“There were a range of views that were expressed by different groups. I think there were certain elements of the cover decision that were welcomed. There were other elements of the cover decision which various parties raised concerns about,” he said during a press conference.Read more about the announcement here. Pelosi defends ‘moral authority’ on climate Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) on Wednesday defended the U.S. “moral authority” on climate change at the COP26 climate summit after being asked about the country’s failure to commit to phasing out coal.Pelosi, who led a delegation of House Democrats to the summit, was asked whether the U.S. retains its “moral authority” after it did not join the coal phase-out agreement, which includes 18 other countries. The U.S. also did not join a 30-country pledge to transition to entirely emissions-free vehicles announced Wednesday at the summit.“I don’t accept the fact that America has not assumed its moral authority in all of this,” Pelosi responded. “American is back, our president was here, there were many successes that were achieved in collaboration — not dictation or condescension — with other countries, many of whom of course were ahead of us because we had the dark period of four years preceding President Biden’s coming into office.”“We have great confidence, we have absolute hope and optimism that the goals will be met,” she added. “People will say what people will say, but we know that America is back, we’ve been yearning to be back.”Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) conceded “political constraints” in the U.S. that may lead to less aggressive climate action.“I hope what you’re hearing here from the delegation is not just a willingness to step up and ask the rest of the world to do better, but we have to do that in the United States as well and you’re right, we have disconnects,” Huffman said.He conceded that despite the ambitious climate provisions of the infrastructure package, it seeks to address methane emissions by “throwing money at the fossil fuel industry to incentivize what frankly we would like to do using other tools such as penalties and regulations.”Read more about Pelosi’s comments here.A MESSAGE FROM EXXONMOBILKEEP ON TRUCKIN’Thirty countries, including the U.K., Canada, Mexico and India, will join six automakers in exclusively producing zero-emissions heavy trucks by 2040, the organizers of the COP26 climate summit announced in a statement Tuesday night.The plan will make the U.K. the first country to commit to a full phase-out of new vehicles weighing 26 metric tons or less by 2035. All such new vehicles sold in the U.K. will be emissions-free by 2040 under the British government’s commitment. The commitment applies to heavy goods vehicles, the European classification for trucks more than 7,716 pounds.However, three of the world’s biggest car markets–the U.S., Japan and China–did not join the agreement, nor did major automakers such as Toyota and Volkswagen. India, the world’s fourth-largest car market, is the the largest market to sign onto the pledge. Several individual U.S. states, including California and Washington State, also signed on.“We know that transport plays a key role saving the planet from warming above 1.5 [degrees Celsius], which is why this is the COP that will kick start our ambition for zero emission aviation and why I’m proud to be uniting world leaders to tackle climate change – creating new opportunities for clean growth, green jobs, and improved air quality right across the globe,” British Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said in a statement. “To support the transition to EVs, it’s integral that we have the infrastructure to support it.”Read more about the agreement here.WHAT WE’RE READING ICYMI That’s it for today, thanks for reading.

https://www.ainonline.com:443/aviation-news/business-aviation/2021-11-10/bizav-ups-sustainability-goals-europe-eyes-mandates,"As the aviation business aviation community resets its sustainability goals with a march toward net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050, Europe and the U.S. alike are moving towards broader environmental mandates with similar goals and an array of potential taxes, incentives, and research projects under discussion, according to Marc Ehudin, director of government affairs for the General Aviation Manufacturers Association.Speaking during AIN’s Building a Sustainable Flight Department forum Wednesday in Dallas, Ehudin provided an overview of the industry’s efforts against the backdrop of actions either already being taken or under consideration in the EU, UK, and U.S.During NBAA-BACE last month, the industry rolled out a commitment to new long-term sustainable goals including continuing improvement of fuel efficiency by 2 percent per year through 2030 and continued carbon-neutral growth from 2020, along with the net-zero 2050 target. They continue and build on the success of goals already set in 2009, including reducing CO2 emissions by 50 percent by 2050, relative to 2005; improving fuel efficiency by 2 percent per year from 2010 until 2020; and achieving carbon-neutral growth from 2020.The new goals were more than a year in the making involving a cross-collaboration spurred by Bombardier and involving other manufacturers and industry participants, Ehudin said, adding they are the result of and take into account multiple factors from aerodynamic advancements to new propulsion types such as electric to the use of sustainable alternative fuel (SAF). Ehudin conceded though, based on current conservative calculations, the industry will need still to do some offsetting in 2050 to meet the target.However, it is important to set this target because it aligns with goals already set in U.S. and Europe. “We think we’re doing well; we’re trying to get better relatively to 2050.”Europe is developing a Fit for 55 proposal that calls for a reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030, compared with 1990 levels with an ambition of putting Europe on track to become the first climate-neutral continent by 2050. Europe hopes to achieve this through mandates, one of which would involve a carbon tax that would begin at the equivalent of $1.78 per gallon of fuel for business aviation in 2023 and continue from there.The initiative would also call for the delivery of SAF—widely believed critical to achieving the business aviation goals—to commercial airports. Ehudin expressed concern, however, that general aviation airports also need to have access to SAF. Comments on this plan are due on November 18, he said.Meanwhile, the UK is looking at Jet Zero to achieve net-zero for aviation by 2050 that is looking at flexibility with multiple solutions, international leadership, and partnerships. This would involve generating demand and providing incentives for SAF, among other initiatives.In the U.S., a number of stepped-up funding for research programs have been floated, as well as initiatives to promote the expansion of SAF. Europe is more focused on taxes and requirements, while the U.S. is focused on incentives.While carbon taxes are discussed in the U.S., he does not believe such a measure would make it through Congress in the upcoming years.However, Ehudin added that what’s happening in Europe will come to the U.S. and “we need to focus on what we can do today to become more sustainable. It’s not going to be easy and it’s not going to be free.”https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2021-11-10/bizav-ups-sustainability-goals-europe-eyes-mandatesCopyright ©2022 AIN Media Group, Inc.

 Rep. Kelly Armstrong who misrepresents us in Congress recently voted against the big infrastructure package.  
 Both Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven represented us correctly and voted for the legislation. Both of our senators have announced that the legislation if fully paid for and authorizes more than $2 billion for the state’s roads and highways and more than $200 million for water projects. It does lots of other things, too, like investing $12 billion in carbon capture and providing broadband to rural areas.  
 It’s obvious that misrepresentative Armstrong is afraid of repercussions from the has been, loser Donald Trump and his cult followers. He put politics ahead of policy and should be banned from the ribbon cuttings this bill will produce.

Later this evening a cold front will be moving through the Ardmore area, and it will cause the temperatures to drop even further. The front will also bring along a chance of thunderstorms. Fortunately the risk of any storms turning severe is marginal.Vivek Mahale, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Norman, said the chance of thunderstorms will begin after sunset.""Wednesday evening we have a chance of thunderstorms in the Ardmore area,"" Mahale said. ""It looks like the most likely time would be around mid evening between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m. There is a marginal risk for severe thunderstorms with the potential of some small hail and high winds.""Mahale said even though the chance of severe storms is only marginal, the chance of rain is high. The Ardmore area is expected to get around a half inch of rain. However some areas could see a much higher or much lower amount.""With thunderstorms you can have very location-based rainfall,"" he said. ""One place could see as much as an inch of rainfall and another area that is extremely close by could see just a tenth of an inch.""The rain will be through the area by the early hours of Thursday morning, and the weather in the following days is forecast to remain sunny and stable.The cold front will also be dropping temperatures, but Mahale said the drop will actually make temperatures more consistent with the averages for this time of year.""It looks like the high for Thursday should be around 64 degrees,"" he said.

https://cnsnews.com/article/international/faycal-benhassain/macrons-plan-build-new-nuclear-reactors-upsets-green,"Paris (CNSNews.com) – An announcement by President Emmanuel Macron that France will build new nuclear reactors to become more energy independent and meet its carbon neutrality goals is angering green activists, who oppose nuclear energy despite it being a major source of low-carbon electricity.In a televised speech, Macron said his plan will also help to keep energy prices down at a time when energy bills are skyrocketing in Europe.“For the first time in decades, we are going to relaunch the construction of nuclear reactors in our country and continue to develop renewable energies,’ he said.The aim will be “to guarantee France’s energy independence, to guarantee our country’s electricity supply and achieve our objectives – in particular, carbon neutrality in 2050.”As most of France’s electricity comes from nuclear plants, he said, “these investments will allow us to reach our commitments when the COP26 [U.N. climate conference] in Glasgow finishes its work.”The announcement marks a big shift for Macron, who in 2018 announced that France would close 14 nuclear reactors by 2035, reducing the nuclear component of national energy supplies from 75 percent to 50 percent.Eric Schahl, a lawmaker with the center-right Union of Democrats and Independents Party, criticized the shift on Twitter, likening Macron’s about-face to the spinning of a wind turbine.Marine Le Pen, presidential candidate in next year’s election for the far-right National Rally, said Macron’s claims were “highly questionable,” and charged that his remarks were merely a pretext to give a campaign speech.Republican Party lawmaker Valérie Pécresse complained that Macron was trying “to steal all the ideas of the right.”Environmental activists reacted negatively to Macron’s announcement.“Revival of nuclear power and construction of new reactors, while the nuclear industry has technical failures coming one after the other endlessly, is totally disconnected from reality,” Nicolas Nace of Greenpeace told media outlets.Macron’s comments were a “denial of democracy,” he said, as decisions on such projects should not be the president’s alone to make.Greens presidential candidate Yannick Jadot called Macron an “agent of nuclear power,” and pointed to nuclear energy costs being considerably higher than those of renewable energy sources.Greens lawmaker Matthieu Orphelin said while Macron’s effort to revive nuclear power was “certainly predictable,” it was also “incredible, and almost illegal” since such a decision called for a national debate.Green campaigners oppose nuclear energy for a range of reasons, including cost and concerns about accidents, waste, and proliferation.Copyright 1998-2022 CNSNews.com.CNSNews.com is a division of the Media Research Center.The mission of the Media Research Center is to

On a fully diluted basis, including options and restricted stock units, Rivian is valued at about $98 billion.Backed by deep-pocketed companies such as Amazon.com Inc. and Ford, Rivian sold 153 million shares Tuesday after marketing 135 million for $72 to $74, a range it had earlier elevated from $57 to $62.The listing is the biggest globally this year, and the sixth-largest ever on a U.S. exchange, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.Rivian is hitting the public markets as it looks to make a dent in the electric vehicle market led by Tesla Inc., which has a market value of more than $1 trillion.Founder and Chief Executive Officer R.J. Scaringe said in a Bloomberg TV interview Wednesday that Rivian’s biggest challenge is the “health of the supply chain” as it ramps up production amid parts shortages.The company’s valuation reflects the company’s ability to scale quickly and its plan to build commercial vehicles, Scaringe said. That starts with 100,000 battery-electric delivery vans for Amazon, which Scaringe described as an “initial order.”In addition to consumer EVs, Tesla has also built out a strong and growing energy-storage business including solar, home and commercial energy storage. Scaringe indicated that Rivian is looking at expanding in similar lines of business.“For us, it’s a question of how do we, as rapidly as possible, transition ourselves away from a fossil-fuel based economy?” Scaringe said. “And that of course has a huge focus on the transportation products. But it also includes energy products. And this is something that we will certainly get into as we really try to accelerate that.”Just a couple of months ago, Rivian delivered its first vehicles, mostly to its own employees. It will only produce about 1,200 units by year-end at its plant in Normal, Illinois. The company, which lost almost $1 billion in the first half of the year, estimates that annual production will hit 150,000 vehicles at its main facility by late 2023.Rivian’s IPO was led by Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co., with more than 20 banks listed on the cover page of its prospectus.

https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-rejects-request-consider-tariffs-solar-panels-three-asian-nations-2021-11-10/,"Nov 10 (Reuters) - U.S. trade officials on Wednesday quashed an effort by a group of domestic solar manufacturers to seek tariffs on panels imported from three South Asian nations, citing the group's request to keep its members anonymous.The rejection was a victory for the largest U.S. solar trade body, which argued that tariffs would cripple a sector that is critical to meeting the Biden administration's goals to bolster clean energy and combat climate change. U.S. solar developers rely on cheap imports to make their projects competitive.The manufacturing group asked the Commerce Department in August to investigate whether imports from Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam were unfair, arguing that Chinese companies had shifted production to those nations in recent years to avoid existing U.S. duties on solar cells and panels made in China.The group, which calls itself the American Solar Manufacturers Against Chinese Circumvention, had argued that identifying its members publicly could expose them to retribution from Chinese industry.In a Wednesday letter to an attorney for the group, an official with the U.S. Commerce Department's International Trade Administration said the companies' request to maintain confidentiality would prevent the agency from obtaining information it needed to evaluate the request.The group's attorney, Timothy Brightbill, said it was reviewing the letter and had no additional comment.The U.S. Solar Energy Industries Association trade body praised the decision, saying it ""provides a rush of certainty for companies to keep their investments moving, hire more workers and deploy more clean energy.""Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Singapore will issue competitive tenders for private companies to invest in new power projects to meet demand over the next five years, Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Tuesday.Reuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/south-county/story/2021-11-30/how-a-chula-vista-based-nonprofit-is-helping-low-income-families,"A Chula Vista-based social services nonprofit is doing its part to curb carbon emissions, particularly in communities hardest hit by air pollution, by helping low-income families purchase electric vehicles.MAAC, formerly known as the Metropolitan Area Advisory Committee, recently launched its Electric Vehicle Access program. Those interested in applying must visit the program’s website at maacproject.org/ev-access. Applications will be accepted through Dec. 1.Pollution tends to be worse for people who live in lower-income communities, said Flora Barron, director of economic development with MAAC.“When looking at, for example, South County, you see that National City, parts of Barrio Logan, down along the border, that these communities are greatly impacted by pollution and so they are in the highest need for cleaner vehicles,” she added.Many residents in low-income neighborhoods, however, have been reluctant to consider going electric because of barriers such as purchase price, vehicle range, availability of charging stations and, generally, not knowing enough about the cars.How it startedThe nonprofit began advocating several years ago for the installation of charging infrastructure in low-income communities but found that, when it was installed, the stations were underused because of low ownership, said Barron.“We started to identify, very organically, additional challenges posed as barriers to electric vehicle ownership,” she said. “The state of California invests quite a lot of money in incentives and rebates and they make them available to low-income individuals. The problem is (accessibility). It’s a very bureaucratic process.”MAAC then partnered with BQuest Foundation — an organization that has funded green San Diego projects — and reached out to the Beneficial State Foundation, which administers a program that offers grants and financing to income-eligible Californians to purchase green vehicles, about the challenges with accessibility.“As a result of those conversations, we were invited to steward their dollars in the San Diego region,” said Barron.With $2 million, the nonprofit launched its program to provide low-interest rate loans of 3.99 percent to 5.99 percent for individuals with low credit scores.How it worksLow- to moderate-income individuals ($60,000 or less per year) who apply can get up to $11,000 in grants and rebates. They can expect to hear back within 10 days rather than the average three months with other programs, said Barron.A vital component of the program is financial literacy coaching on topics such as budgeting, banking and improving one’s credit score. MAAC also informs participants about the benefits of switching to electric vehicles.“The kinds of training and education that we provide are all-inclusive: everything from choosing the right vehicle based on your budget, but also your needs like your commuting patterns,” she said.MAAC’s outreach is “very targeted” toward communities greatly impacted by pollution in the region, said Barron.“It’s really grassroots outreach. So, we have staff that is going into these communities and they’re standing outside of grocery stores, they’re (handing out flyers) at affordable housing complexes,” she said.Marysol Tapiz is a Chula Vista resident who participated in MAAC’s program and is a first-time owner of an electric vehicle. She is among 10 participants who bought a car under the program and MAAC estimates to have about another 70 on the road by June.“There’s no one in my family that has an electric vehicle. We are too scared to run out of electricity because there was just no education on it,” said Tapiz, who owns a 2018 hybrid vehicle. “I would be more comfortable going fully electric now because they know how it works.”Get Essential San Diego, weekday morningsGet top headlines from the Union-Tribune in your inbox weekday mornings, including top news, local, sports, business, entertainment and opinion.

https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/solar-projects-of-107-gw-either-installed-or-under-implementationminister/,"NEW DELHI, Nov 30: Solar energy generation projects totalling 107.46 GW are either installed or under various stages of implementation or tendering, Parliament was informed on Tuesday.
India had set a target of having 100 GW of solar energy by 2022.
“… A total of 107.46 GW solar energy capacity has either been installed or under various stages of implementation or tendering,” Power and New & Renewable Energy R K Singh said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.
The minister informed the House that a total of 46.25 GW of grid connected solar energy capacity has been installed in the country as of October 31, 2021. Further, a total of 36.65 GW capacity is under various stages of implementation and 24.56 GW capacity has been tendered.
He also told the House that 7,555.16 MW of renewable energy capacity has been added during the current fiscal till October 31, 2021.
India has added renewable energy capacity of 7,866.13 MW in 2020-21 and 9,061.26 MW in 2019-20.
In a separate reply to the House, the minister stated, “Renewable energy projects (including large hydro) of capacity 63.64 GW are under various stages of implementation in the country.”
The government has set a target of achieving 175 GW of renewable energy capacity (excluding large hydro) by December 2022.
A total of 150 GW of renewable energy capacity (including large hydro) has been cumulatively installed in the country till date, the minister stated.
In another reply, the minister stated, “Projects of 63.64 GW capacity are under various stages of implementation and 32.06 GW capacity are under various stages of bidding. Therefore, a total of 245.70 GW capacity has either been installed or under various stages of implementation /bidding.”
In another reply, the minister told the House that India has recorded 192,059.71 million units (MU) of electricity from renewable energy sources till September during the current fiscal. (PTI)
Power generation from the RE sources stood at 3,06,312.53 (MU) in 2020-21 and 2,99,900.62 MU in 2019-20.
As per Central Electricity Authority’s National Electricity Plan, contribution of renewable energy sources is estimated to be around 20 per cent of the total electricity demand of the country in the year 2021-22 and 24 per cent by 2026-27, Singh added.

https://www.dailyexcelsior.com/air-pollution-levels-in-delhi-up-again/,"NEW DELHI, Nov 26: Air pollution levels in Delhi worsened on Friday morning due to unfavourable meteorological conditions — low temperature and slow wind speed — and the air quality index read 403 at 9 am, which falls in the severe category.
Low temperatures and slow surface winds allow accumulation of pollutants. The city’s 24-hour average air quality index (AQI) read 400 on Thursday evening.
The air quality in the capital has remained very poor or severe on most of the days in November so far.
Delhi recorded lowest air pollution levels — in terms of 24-hour average quality index — on November 1 (AQI 281) followed by November 23 (AQI 290).
Neighbouring Faridabad (417), Ghaziabad (373), Greater Noida (378), Gurgaon (361) and Noida (383) also saw a dip in air quality on Friday morning.
An AQI between zero and 50 is considered good, 51 and 100 satisfactory, 101 and 200 moderate, 201 and 300 poor, 301 and 400 very poor, and 401 and 500 severe.
Delhi recorded a minimum temperature of 11 degrees Celsius. The maximum temperature is likely to settle around 28 degrees Celsius. According to the Ministry of Earth Sciences’ air quality monitor SAFAR, no relief is likely till Monday.
Local emissions and weather are likely to be the dominant factors controlling air quality, it said.
The Delhi government on Thursday reimposed the ban on construction and demolition activities following the Supreme Court order in this regard.
The apex court reimposed the ban on construction activities in Delhi-NCR on Wednesday until further orders.
Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said the workers affected by the ban on construction activities in the national capital will be provided a financial assistance of Rs 5,000 each and his government will also compensate them for the loss of minimum wages.
The ban on construction and demolition activities was lifted on Monday in view of an improvement in the air quality and the inconvenience caused to the workers.
The Delhi government had on Wednesday decided to resume physical classes in schools, colleges and other educational institutions and reopen government offices from November 29. (PTI)
The ban on the entry of trucks, barring those engaged in essential services, will continue till December 3. However, “CNG and electric trucks will be allowed to enter Delhi from November 27”.
On November 13, the city government had ordered the closure of all educational institutes, banned construction and demolition activities and asked its employees to work from home to combat air pollution and minimise its health effects.
Four days later, it extended the restrictions, besides banning the entry of trucks carrying non-essential items in Delhi. (PTI)Download Daily Excelsior Apps Now:As a subscriber, you will have full access to all of our Newsletters and News Bulletins.Designed Developed & Hosted by Pugmarks."

(KNXV) — Members of the Arizona National Guard rescued an injured hiker by making a landing on the side of a mountain— with only the two front wheels of the aircraft.The flight crew was dispatched on Sunday to assist the Pinal County Sheriff’s Office with an injured hiker who could not get down the mountain.The sheriff’s office was unable to reach the hiker with their aircraft because of high winds.The guardsmen used a Blackhawk helicopter to make a complex two-wheel landing on the side of a sloping ridge that was more than 5,000 feet in elevation.“It’s a little more stressful than a usual landing, but for us, I think it's something we practice enough,” said CW2 Corey McCarthy.The injured hiker was unable to make it down the mountain because of a back injury, but he was able to make it to the chopper himself.“At risk of sounding corny, this is kind of what we live for,” said James Reed, a pilot with the Arizona National Guard.Report a typoAbout Us"

According to reports, particles from the flare are suppose to reach earth early March 7, possibly disrupting technology such as GPS system, satellite networks and airline flights.

 A new solar flare is about to happen this coming Nov. 28. This space was first spotted by NASA's Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO). The international space agency uses SOHO to observe and study the Sun's activity. Although solar flare has been interpreted in various sci-fi films as a devastating Sun storm, Earth hasn't suffered from an extreme category. Although this is the case, NASA and other government-backed space companies are still making an effort to monitor the solar system's center in case extreme solar flares do happen. Recently, TechTimes reported that various solar flares have already happened. This includes the July solar flare, as well as the one that NASA captured. According to The Sun's latest report, SpaceWeather.com, a website that tracks the Northern Lights, said that the upcoming solar flare could bright aurora borealis display. Also Read: ALMA Radio Telescope Just Identified Two Previously Undetectable Galaxies""Much of the CME will miss, sailing south of our planet. But the fraction that hits should be enough to spark bright Arctic auroras,"" said the agency. For those who are worried, NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) confirmed that it is just a minor category or G1 solar storm. This means that it would not be as strong as those shown in the movies, where buildings are being burned. It would also not harm your skin when you go out during its peak.  The Independent UK explained that the upcoming space flare would disrupt satellites and power grids, although it is just a minor solar storm. This is because experts said that the particles released by the Sun would sideswipe the planet's magnetic field. But, astronauts and Earthlings have nothing to worry about since the affected sats and power grids are limited. But, they didn't confirm how long it would last or what areas would be affected.

https://punchng.com/experts-decry-open-waste-burning-amid-projected-2-2bn-tons-refuse-production-rates-in-2025/,"Breaking NewsOgun workers suspend strike after four daysKindly share this story:Societies are undoubtedly in the throes of open waste burning. The World Bank has noted that waste production rates have increased in recent years and are projected to rise significantly in the coming years to 2.2 billion tons per year in 2025.
Open burning of waste is a process in which unwanted products, by-products and materials are incinerated, typically at low temperatures and in an uncontrolled manner. It is used to reduce waste. It’s a normal practice in Nigeria even though the world has moved against it due to its effect on the climate.  An estimated 41 per cent of global waste is burned openly.
Many communities in Nigeria are still immersed in the practice and unaware of the danger such an act is doing to the environment. At the recent COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom, open burning of waste was discussed for the first time and countries called for an end to the practice. More than a million premature deaths are recorded annually due to air pollution, waste and open burning is identified as one of the contributors to increasing levels of pollution especially in urban areas.
Burning waste releases greenhouse gases, air pollutants, reactive trace gases, toxic compounds and short-lived climate pollutants which include black carbon. Black carbon emissions are a leading cause of illness and premature death and have a climate change impact up to 5,000 times greater than CO2.
 
“One of the biggest challenges we face when trying to tackle this issue is a lack of data and the associated lack of awareness about its climate and health impacts at all levels,” says United Nations High Level Climate Champions Lead on waste, Professor Desta Mebratu, of Stellenbosch University.
Mebratu added, “Emissions from open waste burning are hard to characterise and are therefore not widely included in the Nationally Determined Contributions. Some countries recently attempted to incorporate them in their revised NDCs with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.”
Some medical practitioners and scientists have alluded that some cancer-causing ingredients were found in waste burning.  Though efforts have been made by different states across the country to curb the practice, regulation against it appears to focus on urban areas.       
For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.  Related News   Amend 64-year Lunacy Act, experts tell FG  Experts back study, recommend white meat, exercise for erectile function  Food inflation rose by 23.12% August, experts react   
He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

Related News   Amend 64-year Lunacy Act, experts tell FG  Experts back study, recommend white meat, exercise for erectile function  Food inflation rose by 23.12% August, experts react   
He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

Many communities in Nigeria are still immersed in the practice and unaware of the danger such an act is doing to the environment. At the recent COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom, open burning of waste was discussed for the first time and countries called for an end to the practice. More than a million premature deaths are recorded annually due to air pollution, waste and open burning is identified as one of the contributors to increasing levels of pollution especially in urban areas.
Burning waste releases greenhouse gases, air pollutants, reactive trace gases, toxic compounds and short-lived climate pollutants which include black carbon. Black carbon emissions are a leading cause of illness and premature death and have a climate change impact up to 5,000 times greater than CO2.
 
“One of the biggest challenges we face when trying to tackle this issue is a lack of data and the associated lack of awareness about its climate and health impacts at all levels,” says United Nations High Level Climate Champions Lead on waste, Professor Desta Mebratu, of Stellenbosch University.
Mebratu added, “Emissions from open waste burning are hard to characterise and are therefore not widely included in the Nationally Determined Contributions. Some countries recently attempted to incorporate them in their revised NDCs with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.”
Some medical practitioners and scientists have alluded that some cancer-causing ingredients were found in waste burning.  Though efforts have been made by different states across the country to curb the practice, regulation against it appears to focus on urban areas.       
For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”

 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.  Related News   Amend 64-year Lunacy Act, experts tell FG  Experts back study, recommend white meat, exercise for erectile function  Food inflation rose by 23.12% August, experts react   
He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’

On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.

He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

https://punchng.com/experts-decry-open-waste-burning-amid-projected-2-2bn-tons-refuse-production-rates-in-2025/,"Breaking NewsOgun workers suspend strike after four daysKindly share this story:Societies are undoubtedly in the throes of open waste burning. The World Bank has noted that waste production rates have increased in recent years and are projected to rise significantly in the coming years to 2.2 billion tons per year in 2025.
Open burning of waste is a process in which unwanted products, by-products and materials are incinerated, typically at low temperatures and in an uncontrolled manner. It is used to reduce waste. It’s a normal practice in Nigeria even though the world has moved against it due to its effect on the climate.  An estimated 41 per cent of global waste is burned openly.
Many communities in Nigeria are still immersed in the practice and unaware of the danger such an act is doing to the environment. At the recent COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom, open burning of waste was discussed for the first time and countries called for an end to the practice. More than a million premature deaths are recorded annually due to air pollution, waste and open burning is identified as one of the contributors to increasing levels of pollution especially in urban areas.
Burning waste releases greenhouse gases, air pollutants, reactive trace gases, toxic compounds and short-lived climate pollutants which include black carbon. Black carbon emissions are a leading cause of illness and premature death and have a climate change impact up to 5,000 times greater than CO2.
 
“One of the biggest challenges we face when trying to tackle this issue is a lack of data and the associated lack of awareness about its climate and health impacts at all levels,” says United Nations High Level Climate Champions Lead on waste, Professor Desta Mebratu, of Stellenbosch University.
Mebratu added, “Emissions from open waste burning are hard to characterise and are therefore not widely included in the Nationally Determined Contributions. Some countries recently attempted to incorporate them in their revised NDCs with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.”
Some medical practitioners and scientists have alluded that some cancer-causing ingredients were found in waste burning.  Though efforts have been made by different states across the country to curb the practice, regulation against it appears to focus on urban areas.       
For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.  Related News   Amend 64-year Lunacy Act, experts tell FG  Experts back study, recommend white meat, exercise for erectile function  Food inflation rose by 23.12% August, experts react   
He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning.

Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.

These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

Many communities in Nigeria are still immersed in the practice and unaware of the danger such an act is doing to the environment. At the recent COP26 UN Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, United Kingdom, open burning of waste was discussed for the first time and countries called for an end to the practice. More than a million premature deaths are recorded annually due to air pollution, waste and open burning is identified as one of the contributors to increasing levels of pollution especially in urban areas.
Burning waste releases greenhouse gases, air pollutants, reactive trace gases, toxic compounds and short-lived climate pollutants which include black carbon. Black carbon emissions are a leading cause of illness and premature death and have a climate change impact up to 5,000 times greater than CO2.
 
“One of the biggest challenges we face when trying to tackle this issue is a lack of data and the associated lack of awareness about its climate and health impacts at all levels,” says United Nations High Level Climate Champions Lead on waste, Professor Desta Mebratu, of Stellenbosch University.
Mebratu added, “Emissions from open waste burning are hard to characterise and are therefore not widely included in the Nationally Determined Contributions. Some countries recently attempted to incorporate them in their revised NDCs with support from the Climate and Clean Air Coalition.”
Some medical practitioners and scientists have alluded that some cancer-causing ingredients were found in waste burning.  Though efforts have been made by different states across the country to curb the practice, regulation against it appears to focus on urban areas.       
For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.

On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.  Related News   Amend 64-year Lunacy Act, experts tell FG  Experts back study, recommend white meat, exercise for erectile function  Food inflation rose by 23.12% August, experts react   
He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

For instance, in Lagos where there’s a waste collection system via the state waste management authority and other private companies, the waste is dumped at a dump located in  Olusosun dumpsite in Ketu area of Lagos and it always fouls the air whenever it’s burnt.
Not long ago, the Ogun State government warned residents against burning of refuse in the state. It noted that dumping waste on the road had become a crime, adding that the act could lead to carbon dioxide generation.
Commenting on the issue, a Professor of Medical Geography at the Bayero University Kano, Yusuf Adamu, said that there were health implications of burning waste close to residential areas beyond its impact on the climate and deterioration of the ozone layer.
He said, “The effect of open waste burning is that unhealthy gases are released into the atmosphere. The gases pollute the air and over a long period of time, it begins to affect the health of the people particularly their throats and lungs. It may lead to certain respiratory tract infections. These gases are dangerous to health but it is not something that happens in a short time.  It’s a build up effect that we have on the ozone layer.
 “The soil is also affected and contaminated and the houses around an area where waste is being burned openly are polluted by heavy matter. The ground will be contaminated. If there are open waters around the area, they would also be contaminated.’’
On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.

On his part, a climatologist at the Modibbo Adama University of Technology, Yola, Adamawa State, Prof. Adebayo Aderemi, said waste burning could affect the environment and subsequently the health of those within the area.
He said, “It releases gases into the atmosphere which would pollute the atmosphere and that has consequences. One of the gases which pollute the air is called nitrogen oxide.”      
The lecturer described nitrogen oxide as a mixture of nitrogen compounds which he noted were responsible for global warming.
Aderemi added, “There is also another gas called volatile organic compounds. They are carbon-based compounds, which when they react to sunlight, will be released into the atmosphere in the form of compounds such as ozone and smog.”
He further stated that such activities could produce carbon monoxide reacting with sunlight and creating harmful substances.

He added, “Carbon monoxide is a significant greenhouse guard which causes global warming. In addition, we have what is called a particle solution or particle matter. These are particles that produce visible smoke and reduce visibility. The particles create an unhealthy atmosphere and also make the home dirty. They can cause serious health issues. They pollute the air and some of them have negative effects on the ozone layer and cause global warming and climate change.”
Aderemi explained that beyond the effects of waste burning and smoke emission on the climate, they could also impact negatively on human health, causing cancer and affecting gases and important organs in the body.
Saying such particles cause cancer being carcinogenic, he added that carbon monoxide could affect the respiratory organs and system. He stated, “They can also affect the kidney and other vital organs in the body. The gases can lead to irritation in the throat. The ash produced by the smoke can be toxic to the body. These are some of the health implications of uncontrolled burning of solid waste.”
Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”

Also, a Professor of Environmental Sustainability and Environmental Education, Kola Olusanya, said that it was unfortunate that Nigeria still engaged in waste burning because of backwardness among other third-world countries.        
He said, “We have China, India and Brazil and these countries have already found solutions to open waste burning. Open waste burning is not just dangerous to the climate in itself; it is far more dangerous to the ozone layer. Waste dumps, naturally without putting fire in them, contain enough chemicals that can ignite themselves and when this kind of smoke mixes with chemicals, the smoke that one gets isn’t the same one gets from firewood. They are toxic smoke because they contain chemicals. The effects will last longer beyond the ordinary smoke.
“This means that if we need to take into consideration climate change, ozone layer depletion and also playing our role like other countries as concluded at the recently held climate change conference in Glasgow, Nigeria needs to embrace serious waste management techniques.”
Olusanya stated that the country had to engage in waste sorting to throw away only those fit for the dump.
He added, “In countries where waste separation is common, the idea of dealing with waste is a way of controlling what litters the environment. We have a situation where waste like food is being turned into compost. Other waste has been separated and recycled and sold back to factories to reproduce plastic products. By the time that has been done, you’d find out that the landfill is reduced.
“We also have the electronic waste which is a major challenge we are having in Nigeria now because of the second hand market for goods brought in from abroad. After usage, they eventually become a part of our waste and go to the landfill and they produce toxic chemical thick smoke that will be going to the environment.”
The professor stated that beyond affecting the climate and the ozone layer, it was dangerous to human health.
He added, “If we engage in waste reduction, waste separation, these would reduce what goes into the landfill and what goes into the landfill will be what is not dangerous because we would have removed what is dangerous from there. And they would have been recycled; we can’t just start talking about recycling, because it has been there. We need to get more involved in it seriously.      
“If you see the waste managers in Lagos, Ibadan, Abuja and other places, you’d notice that the waste being collected is collected together and disposed of together.  In other climes, from point of collection, waste is taken to sorting centres, where they are separated and it is only those that are no longer useful that would be discarded.’’
According to him, it’s high time the country got serious with its waste management and the government also needs cogent policies to take effect from homes.
Olusanya stated, “For example, in the home, get different waste bags. You don’t put waste in the same waste bag you put tissues papers in. There should be another for plastic bottles, sachet water and others. By the time we do this, we will discover that the waste that gets to the landfill will be insignificant.”
